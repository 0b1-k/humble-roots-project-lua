09/24/16,08:00:00 AM,"Started soaking 5 AK-48 seeds into a vial at room temperature"
09/25/16,08:00:00 AM,"All 5 seeds are fully saturated with water and dropped at the bottom of the vial. Placed all seeds between 2 moist paper towels under a cup and into the incubator."
09/26/16,08:00:00 AM,"3 seeds have germinated enough to be potted and placed into the incubator"
09/26/16,07:00:00 PM,"2 more seeds have germinated enough to be potted and placed into the incubator"

10/01/16,08:00:00 AM,"Watered"
10/02/16,10:00:00 AM,"Watered and moved all seedlings out of the incubator into the lab under the small LED lamp. Note: one of the seedling is significantly smaller than the others and shows leaf malformations. This seedling happened to be buried deeper into its starter pot than the others and took longer to emerge from the soil. Coincidence?"

10/07/16,08:00:00 AM,"Watered"
10/08/16,08:00:00 AM,"Watered"
10/09/16,04:20:00 PM,"Transplanted all plants"
10/13/16,06:45:00 PM,"Watered all plants. All plants look good and show no sign of post-transplant shock."
10/15/16,09:15:00 PM,"Watered all plants. All plants look good. Turned fan on."
10/16/16,06:05:00 PM,"Added second soil RH probe to the central plant, measuring the top portion of the soil. Irrigation is now using both probes to determine when to irrigate."
10/30/16,07:15:00 PM,"Topped all plants except for the smallest one. Fed all plants FloraGro (1/3 of full strength: 5ml / 3 Gal). Some leaves show nitrogen deficiency (pale green) and some dark spots in places."
11/01/16,09:00:00 PM,"Fed all plants with CaliMagic (15ml, +1ml ph up, 6.8 pH). Plants look healthier after being fed some FloraGrow. However, it is now clear that Calcium Magnesium is needed."
11/02/16,09:00:00 PM,"Fed all plants with CaliMagic (15ml, +1ml ph up, 6.8 pH)"
11/05/16,08:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with FloraGro (10ml, +1ml ph up, 6.5 pH)"
11/06/16,06:50:00 PM,"Fed all plants with FloraMicro 15ml, 6.5 pH."
11/10/16,07:10:00 PM,"Observed signs of sexing on plants. This is odd because they're not auto-flowering seeds (or are they?). It is likely a sign of stress but from what?. I believe the lamp is too close to the plants. Raised it 1” and will gradually continue to raise it. Starting feeding for transition to flowering."
11/12/16,06:05:00 PM,"Switched to 12 hours of light schedule. Fed all plants with Open Sesame ¼ strength (3.75Gr / 3 Gals, +5ml ph UP, 5.2pH → 6.4). Raised light by 1”. Turned small LED light on."
11/13/16,07:30:00 PM,"Raised lamp by 1”. All plants look good."
11/14/16,07:30:00 PM,"Raised lamp by 1”. All plants look good."
11/17/16,07:00:00 PM,"All plants look good. Placed net over the plants. Noticed that the irrigation of the plants in FFOF soil is not working well: they need more water."
11/18/16,06:05:00 PM,"Fed all plants with Open Sesame ¼ strength (3.75Gr / 3 Gals, +5ml ph UP, 5.2pH → 6.6). All plants look good"
11/19/16,07:00:00 PM,"Buds are appearing"
11/23/16,07:00:00 PM,"Fed all plants with CaliMagic (15ml)"
11/26/16,06:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with Open Sesame ¼ strength (3.75Gr / 3 Gals, +5ml ph UP → 6.4 pH). Trimmed all the plants and removed all low level branches."
11/29/16,07:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with Beastie Bloomz (3.75 Gr / 3 Gals, +6ml pH up → 6.4 pH). The plants in KISS soil continue to show yellowing leaves."
12/01/16,07:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with Beastie Bloomz (3.75 Gr / 3 Gals, +6ml pH up → 6.5 pH). The plants in KISS soil continue to show yellowing leaves."
12/04/16,07:45:00 PM,"Plants in KISS soil show sign of Nitrogen deficiency, I believe. Too many lower, older leaves turning yellow. Plants in FFOF soil are not showing the same symptoms. Switching to Cha-Ching to bring back some nitrogen into the nutrient mix while maintaining flowering nutrients ( 0 - 50 - 30 ) → ( 9 - 50 - 10 ). 7.5 Gr Cha-Ching → 5.2 pH + 15ml pH up → 6.5 pH. Raised light by 2” as the tallest plants in the center of the patch looked too close to the big lamp."
12/06/16,06:35:00 PM,"Fed all plants with Cha-Ching (7.5 Gr + 15 ml pH up). The plants in KISS soil continue to show yellowing leaves."
12/08/16,07:10:00 PM,"Fed all plants with 20ml of CaliMagic. All plants continue to lose yellowing leaves"
12/09/16,06:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with Cha-Ching (7.5 Gr + 15 ml pH up). The plants in KISS soil continue to show yellowing leaves."
12/13/16,07:00:00 PM,"Switch to Cha- Ching"
12/12/16,08:05:00 PM,"Fed all plants with 7.5 Gr Cha-Ching + 15ml pH Up → 6.5 pH. Continued yellowing."
12/14/16,08:05:00 PM,"Fed all plants with 7.5 Gr Cha-Ching + 15ml pH Up → 6.5 pH."
12/17/16,06:45:00 PM,"Fed all plants with 7.5 Gr Cha-Ching + 15ml pH Up → 6.5 pH. Yellowing progression has slowed down. Plants look good."
12/18/16,06:30:00 PM,"All plants look good. Trimmed lower sucker branches / buds from all plants. Lowered humidity from 58 to 50 to increase trichome production. Yellowing is under control."
12/19/16,07:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with 7.5 Gr Cha-Ching + 15ml pH Up → 6.5 pH. Plants look good."
12/21/16,06:30:00 PM,"Fed all plants with 7.5 Gr Cha-Ching + 15ml pH Up → 6.5 pH. Plants look good. Lowered air RH from 50% to 48%. Raised by 1.5” and re-oriented the small LED lamp."
